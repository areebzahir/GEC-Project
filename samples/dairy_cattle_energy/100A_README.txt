Methodological information
-
1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Cows were housed in a free-stall pen equipped with a stationary GreenFeed gas exchange monitor (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, USA) and 15 automated feed stations (Insentec, Hokofarm, Marknesse, The Netherlands) for a period of 4 wk.  Cows had individual free access to a partial mixed ration and water throughout the study and were milked twice daily at 0530 and 1730 h. On their return from the milking parlour, body weights and condition scores were recorded with a 3-D imaging camera (DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden). 

2. People involved with data collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: Kedzierski, Patricia; Reyes, Carolina; van der Hout, Aliena (University of Guelph).
